Location for LFRic infrastructure documentation. Once the great repository split has occurred the actual source code may join it.

To build the sphinx docs you will need to use the `lfric-core-docs/1.0.0` environment made specifically for this (it contains Sphinx and the required packages), building is done with `make html` in the documentation directory. `make help` will give you the other options available.
