Application Configuration
=========================

Application configuration can be defined by Rose metadata including
some :ref:`extensions <extended rose metadata>` to Rose
metadata. Using such extensions allows a tool called the
:ref:`Configurator <configurator>` to generate the code required to
read configuration namelists into the application.

This section describes summarises how the code within the application
can access and use the application configuration options for
applications that are built using the functions of the Configurator.
