=================================
`&cubedsphere_mesh`
=================================
Control namelist for cubed-sphere mesh generation, required for use with ``cubdedsphere_mesh_generator``.

* ``edge_cells``:``<comma separated integers>``
    Number of cells along edge of mesh panel. Only the first n-entries given be :ref:`n_meshes<n_meshes>` are used. 
* ``smooth_passes``:``<integer>``
    Number of interations of smoothing function applied to mesh node locations. This has most impact at the corners of the cube topology.
* ``equatorial_latitude``:``<real>``
    Real world latitude (degrees) of Cubed-Sphere mesh equator after applying Schmit transform.
    The `top`(or `bottom`) panels of the cubed-sphere are reduced in size while maintaining the
    same connectivity. This has the effect of a localised increase in resolution over a panel of
    the cubed-sphere without increasing the overall number of cells in the mesh.

.. note:: Any configuration variable of polar coordinates are to be specified in ``<Degrees Longitude>, <Degrees Latitude>`` on real world frame of reference.
